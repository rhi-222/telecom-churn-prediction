# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project develops a **machine learning model** to predict telecom customer churn, helping businesses retain high-risk customers. The model identifies key churn indicators and provides actionable insights for targeted customer retention.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- **Data Processing** (Feature Engineering, Class Balancing)
- **Model Evaluation** (AUC-ROC, Accuracy, Precision-Recall)

## Key Achievements
- **Built and compared multiple models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict customer churn.
- **Achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.85**, optimizing model hyperparameters for improved prediction accuracy.
- **Performed extensive feature engineering**, analyzing contract types, payment methods, and service usage patterns to identify key churn indicators.
- **Implemented data balancing techniques** to enhance model performance and mitigate class imbalance issues.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rhi-222/telecom-churn-prediction.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
- Open `telecom_churn_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Execute each cell to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

Results & Next Steps
- The model successfully identifies high-risk customers, allowing for proactive retention strategies.
- Future improvements include exploring deep learning approaches (e.g., neural networks) and incorporating customer behavioral insights for better predictions.
